    Hello.<br>
    This is where we learn about the Google Easter Eggs.<br>

    1. Go to elgoog.com to get easter Eggs<br>
    2. Go to chrome://dino to play the dino game.<br>
    3. Search askew for a tilted screen.<br>
    4. Search "do a barrel roll" for your screen to spin.<br>
    5. Search cats or dogs to press the paw button and see them!<br>
    That is all i know.
