    WHAT WAS THE FIRST GOOGLE EASTER EGG?<br>
    Well, the first Google easter egg was made in 1998.<br>
    But, sadly, this Google easter egg no longer exists.<br>
    This is what it did:<br>
    If you searched "Google" in the search bar, it would say "Did you mean... BackRub?"<br>
    WHY?<br>
    Well, Google's original name was "BackRub". But, they renamed it to Google.<br>
